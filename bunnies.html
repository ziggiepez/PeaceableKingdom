      <h2>Adoption Info</h2>

      <p>
        As per our adoption policies, our rabbits are adopted out to be family members. We do not adopt out our rabbits to live in outdoor hutches, to be children's pets, classroom pets, 4H projects or basement bunnies. Our buns are adopted to homes where they will live inside for their entire lives and be spoiled rotten.

      <h2>JELLY & BEAN</h2>

      <p>Meet Jelly and Bean! These handsome boys had a rough start. Several bunnies were released near a very busy road near several apartments. Sadly, one of the bunnies was hit by a car. Thankfully, a group of volunteers spent several hours to save these two! Because of this, we can only guess their age to be around 1-2 years old. They must be adopted together as they are very bonded to one another. They were neutered on April 9th 2021 and are ready for their forever home. *We adopt to indoor only homes* *We require all members of a household to be involved in the adoption process* *We do NOT adopt any animals as gifts/surprises*

      <h2>VESPA</h2>

      <p>How many nice things can we say about our beautiful girl Vespa? The answer is simple - the limit does not exist. Vespa has flourished since coming into our care from another shelter in a large city. She was brought in there as a stray with another rabbit (who was her “mini me”, we think may have been her daughter) and they were separated upon arrival. After over a month of her being there, we came to her rescue and pulled her to the safety of our program. The other rabbit brought in with her has been adopted while at that shelter. Vespa was timid and shy for the first 3 weeks of being with us. Then one day she decided to wait at her pen door to be let out and explore the room instead of running away like usual, and also started to boop us from behind as we cleaned her pen.
