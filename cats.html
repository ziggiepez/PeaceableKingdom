      <h2>CLIFFORD</h2>

      <p>Sweet Clifford is a gentle soul who is waiting patiently for a new home.
        Clifford was found outside amongst a feral cat colony after being abandoned.
        Clifford has a very gentle, shy demeanor. He does not draw attention to himself, but when you start petting him he instantly comes out of his shell. We find he was much more outgoing upon his arrival to the shelter but over time has becomes slightly depressed and sleeps most of his day away.
        Clifford has been diagnosed with FIV. He also suffers from stomatitis which is kept under control with steroids. He recently had a dental to clean up his teeth!
