      <h2>MISSY</h2>

      <p>We adopted Missy in 2013. We never imagined ourselves owning a small dog. We already had a golden retriever at home. Missy has definitely won us over and has been such a wonderful addition to our family. She is a very loving and caring dog.

      <h2>BOWSER</h2>

      <p>
        About a year ago we adopted Bowser, a peke/shih tzu mix. He is such a ball of energy and LOVES toys. His best friend is our 80 pound husky mix, they sleep together, eat together, play together, even SWIM TOGETHER. Bowser loves to play and loves the pool, he’s always jumping in and out of it. Twice a week he gets to go to doggie daycare to see all of his other friends. We are so happy with adopting him, he is such a funny dog and gives us so much happiness!

      <h2>CLOVER</h2>

      <p>I can't believe how well miss Clover has fit right into our family. Clover is now the queen of our house and thriving. She loves her millions of toys and cuddling/sleeping with us on the couch (we had originally planned on no couch that didn't last long!). Her personality matches us so well and we love her so much. A big thanks for all the work done by PK volunteers, fosters, donators, and everyone - thank you for bringing our best friend to us!!!

      <h2>CEECEE</h2>

      <p>
        About 9 years ago, my husband and I adopted a 1 year old black and white Shih Tzu from one of your adoption days at a pet store in Whitehall. We named CeeCee. She is one of the highlights of our days. She is a funny, silly girl who is stubborn and crabby when she feels like it and loves to run around our neighborhood when she can sneak out through our legs and go visiting our neighbors who all love her. She even had a job for several months at a pet supply store as the official greeter.

      <h2>BRODY & MIA</h2>

      <p>It’s been almost 8 months since we’ve adopted Brody ( formally known as Buddy) and Mia, and we are all loving life! We’ve been all over PA and even visited NYC and LI! We love car rides!
        We might even take a trip across the US next summer! Life is good for our little blue-eyed doggies, and we love them dearly.

      <h2>BIG BOSS & SKYE</h2>

      <p>
        Big Boss (formerly known as Addison) and Skye (formerly known as Tonto) enjoying their new home. Big Boss and Skye immediately made themselves at home, jumping on our laps, laying on us, and thriving for attention. They play together, sleep together, and enjoy waking me up early in the morning for breakfast. I'm so glad that these two beautiful girls came into our lives.

      <h2>SARAH</h2>

      <p>  I adopted Sarah, now named Peppermint, on April 27, 2022. She is the best bunny ever. She loves to hop around the kitchen every morning and play with her cardboard barn. Her pen is filled with toys and the cabin from her foster mom she loves that too. My 2 grandkids adore her and want to visit more now just to see the bunny. She even gets along with my old Shih Tzu, Snickers.
