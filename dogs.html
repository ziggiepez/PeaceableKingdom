      <h2>ANNIE</h2>

      <p>Meet sweet Annie, who was returned to PK after being adopted years ago. Sadly her owner went into a nursing home, so Annie is in search of a family with whom to spend the next chapter of her life. Annie is an 8-year-old pitbull mix. She currently weighs 84 lbs but very much needs to lose weight, so she will need to be in a home that will prioritize a healthy diet and exercise. Annie is very friendly and easy-going. We are unsure of how she is with other dogs or cats, but Annie can live in a home with children. She currently has a skin infection but is on antibiotics to treat it.

      <h2>AUGUST</h2>

      <p>This is August, a friendly husky mix who is ready to find herself a new family! August is 3 years old, weighs 47 lbs., and was surrendered to PK after a family member became allergic to her. August is friendly and outgoing. She gets along with small dogs, some bigger dogs (she’s a bit more selective with larger breeds), and has spent time around children of all ages. She can be cat-tested if requested. August walks well on a leash, is house- and crate-trained, and knows multiple commands. One of her eyes was injured when she was a newborn puppy, but the injury doesn’t bother her. August is a great family dog and would fit right into lots of homes!

      <h2>BLANCHE</h2>

      <p> Meet Blanche, a 4–5-year-old, 17-lb., Bichon Frise. Blanche was rescued from a puppy mill and is now in search of a better life. Like many puppy mill dogs, she is shy and hesitant and hasn’t let us see her true personality yet. Blanche is a sweetheart though and loves watching her surroundings. She enjoys the company of other dogs and would do well in a home with another confident dog. Blanche will need a family who are patient and allow her time to come out of her shell. At first, as she gets settled, Blanche will be a flight risk, so all family members must be very careful with doors/gates and she cannot be left unattended outdoors. We are looking for her furever home that has a fenced yard for Blanche to explore and learn how to dog, safely. Blanche can be kitty-tested. She would be fine with responsible kids who will keep her safe in the house.

      <h2>CLANCY</h2>

      <p>This is fancy Clancy, a shy little poodle who was rescued from a puppy mill. Clancy is around 5 years old and weighs 11 lbs. Clancy is sweet, gentle, and very quiet, but we expect this is because he is still shut down and hasn’t learned how to express his little personality (we see this a lot with mill dogs). Clancy likes to be around other dogs and would do well in a home with another confident dog who could show him the ropes. Clancy will need a family who is patient and will give him time to come out of his shell. During his initial months in a new home, as he builds trust, he will be a flight risk, so all family members must be very careful with doors/gates and he cannot be left unattended outdoors. Clancy can be kitty-tested and would be fine with responsible kids who make sure to keep him safe in the house. This little angel is ready to learn all the joys of living in a loving home. Might you be the right home for Clancy to blossom?

      <h2>DOROTHY</h2>

      <p> Have you traveled down the road and back again in search of a pal and a confidant? Well, look no further, the Golden Girls are available for adoption at PK! Introducing Dorothy, a sweet 4–5-year-old Bichon Frise weighing in at 19 pounds. Dorothy's journey began in a puppy mill, but after busting out, she’s looking forward to a brighter future. Observant and gentle, Dorothy finds solace in the company of furry friends and would thrive in a home with a confident canine companion. Vigilance is necessary initially, as Dorothy may be inclined to run off, making careful monitoring around doors and gates imperative. We are looking for her furever home that has a fenced yard for Dorothy to explore and learn how to dog, safely. She can be kitty-tested if you have cats at home. Also, she would be fine in a home with responsible children who will keep her safe indoors.

      <h2>LUNA</h2>

      <p>We are so excited to introduce Luna. This absolute charmer is a 6-year-old German Shepherd mix. Luna was extremely loved by her owner, and they had a deep bond; however, her owner was involved in a devastating accident that left the owner hospitalized and unable to care for Luna. Luna was out of sorts at the shelter. She doesn’t like being crated and wants to be near people. She has been in a foster home for the last month and is thriving! She loves running in the snow and going on long walks. Luna must be the only pet in the home because she doesn’t want to share her human’s attention! Luna is a big girl at 106 lbs. Luna must undergo Tibial Tuberosity Advancement (TTA) surgery, which will be provided by PK. Although she cannot be formally adopted until surgery is complete, we are open to foster-to-adopt arrangements to help get her into a loving home as soon as possible.

      <h2>PEANUT</h2>

      <p> We have adorable puppies ready for adoption at PK! Mama Penelope, a 40-pound bully mix, raised a healthy litter of 10 babies (born 2/6/2024) who are now ready to go to their forever homes. We don’t know dad’s breed, but we expect the puppies to be medium sized once full grown. Because they are puppies, they should fit right into most homes, including those with dogs, cats, and kids. Say hello to little Peanut. This baby girl is not the dominant one of the group but instead follows along with whatever her siblings are doing. She’s energetic, but not especially high-energy. Peanut doesn’t seem to be as into cuddling as some of her siblings, but she’s too busy following the others around to have time for that! She’s been doing a great job using the designated towels for potty-time, so we are hopeful she’ll pick up housetraining quickly.

We don’t know dad’s breed, but we expect the puppies to be medium sized once full grown. Because they are puppies, they should fit right into most homes, including those with dogs, cats, and kids. Meet Pepperoncini! This girl is SPUNKY. She has lots of energy and sass for being such a tiny thing. She’s very mouthy and will need some help breaking that habit as she gets older. Although Pepperoncini has lots of energy, she also crashes quickly and loves a good cuddle then. She is resistant to pottying on the designated towels, so this girl may take a little extra work when it comes to training. We think Pepperoncini will have a big personality when she grows up!

Pierogi has been doing a great job using the designated towels for potty-time, so we think he’ll pick up housetraining quickly.

      <p>Meet Pinky, a petite Chihuahua mix with the most beautiful hazel-green eyes! Pinky is young at around 1–2 years old and weighs 12 lbs. She was transferred to us from another shelter. Pinky is very nervous in the shelter setting and needs time to warm up to new people. Once she gets past her fears and becomes comfortable with you, she turns into a sweetheart though. She really enjoys car rides! Pinky is very vocal, so she'll need to be in a home without shared walls. Because of Pinky's nervousness, she should be in an adult-only household. She's open to meeting other dogs, if you have them in the home, and can be cat-tested if requested. Pinky is a dog that needs time to come out of her shell, but once she welcomes you into her circle, you'll be rewarded with her affection.

Meet Popcorn, an adorable baby boy! Popcorn is social and loves to be the center of attention. Hed is always the first to run over to greet visitors in the puppy room. He’s also very mouthy right now! Popcorn is high energy and absolutely loves to play. In fact, he would rather play with his sibling than cuddle. He’s still learning where to go potty in the puppy room so he might take a little extra help with potty-training.

      <p>Pretty Pippa is ready for adoption! Pippa landed at PK after being found wandering near the Allentown Farmer’s Market. Pippa is a Border Collie/Australian Shepherd mix weighing in at 51 lbs. The vet estimates that Pippa is around 8 years old. Pippa is sweet, quiet, and a little tentative. She loves calmly watching all the activity at the shelter. Pippa keeps her kennel clean and tidy, so she was clearly housetrained. Pippa would be open to meeting other dogs if you have them in your household. She could be cat-tested if requested. She would be fine in a home with children who treat her gently and with respect. She’ll also need an owner who is willing and able to keep her thick coat properly groomed. She recently had a dental cleaning and is all ready for her new family! Please consider giving this sweetheart a second chance at happiness.
